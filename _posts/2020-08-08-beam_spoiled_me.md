title: The BEAM has Spoiled Me

I've noticed changes in how I prefer to develop software since I've been
focusing my career on Elixir. It allows me to think bigger thoughts and to
develop with lower friction and less fear. I don't want to go back.

## It Began with Fault Tolerance

Many people are introduced to Elixir because of its focus on concurrency.  Joe
Armstrong even called Erlang a "concurrency oriented" language. (Note: most of
my points are generic to any BEAM language, but my experience comes from an
Elixir perspective, so please excuse bias in my terminology). I find it helpful
to consider concurrency a logical consequence of a more primeval concern: fault
tolerance. Achieving BEAM-style fault tolerance comes from isolated processes
which do not affect any other if they crash, plus a supervisory process being
informed when another process dies.

The core point of processes is to contain the "blast radius" of damage caused
by an error. It just so happens that the isolation qualities that enable that
also make them great candidates for concurrency.

## "Let It Crash"

When I first heard the "Let It Crash" mantra of the Erlang community, it
sounded crazy based on my prior development exerience. It's important to
understand that it is not a license for irresponsibility, or that we should not
care about the system crashing. What it is, at the core, is a recognition that
our systems will have errors (even _if_ we write bug-free code, hardware will
bug us eventually) and that with an architecture of managing the "blast radius"
of damage, then little parts of the system crashing are no longer a scary
thing.

Less fear -- yes, please! I've learned to write my Elixir code with a focus
on "blast radius" as a driver for when to reach for processes. Even in cases where I
don't need concurrency, I'll use a process to enclose the damage an error might
cause. I use supervision trees and durable work queues to recover from those
minor crashes of processes.  I've learned to prefer upserts over inserts to
allow my logic to be retried safely for greater idempotency. These two ideas
of processes to enclose possible errors plus idempotency have become second
nature to me in any Elixir code I write.

## Freedom

This automatic ability to recover from errors changes the complexion of topics
like test coverage enforcement, static types, extensive code reviews, etc. All
those, at heart, are about preventing errors from being introduced in the first
place (yes, I recognize their secondary benefits too). Those are still good
things (I am not advocating irresponsibility), but with the solid safety net of
fault tolerance from BEAM, we are able to look at them from a different
perspective and see that they do add some friction and inertia to delivering
software.  Perhaps we can temper our reliance upon them in favor of greater
delivery speed in some circumstances. Less fear means more freedom to choose.

## Bigger Thoughts

Elixir re-ignited my intellectual interest in software development. I found,
via Erlang and BEAM history in general, a huge body of wisdom in distributed
systems that I can learn from, and new tools in my toolbox of how to think
about software. With processes so lightweight, pervasive, and offering freedom
from fear of crashing, my perspective shifted in exciting ways. If I think I'm
writing a "web application" then my thoughts are immediately limited. I now
think of building systems. I can think bigger thoughts because I have better
abstractions to build them upon.

Some teams are happy to use Elixir to write web applications, to fit it into
their pre-existing microservice deployment model. I urge developers to reach
for those bigger thoughts that fault tolerant lighweight processes enable. You
can consider each process a logical microservice, but you don't need the
friction of deploying it separately, and serializing to/from json, and
containers, and orchestration, and distributed logging, et.al.  You can deploy an
entire system of millions of interacting logical microservices in a single BEAM
release.

## Game Changer

Elixir and BEAM certainly have been a game changer for me. I'm more fearless when I
build systems, and I hope I can share that freedom with others. The BEAM has spoiled
me, but in a good way.
