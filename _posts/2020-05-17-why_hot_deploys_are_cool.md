title: Why Hot Deploys are Cool
tags: elixir deployment
---
I've become an unintentional nonconformist in the Elixir community because I
LOVE hot deploys. I try to keep newcomers' minds open to the possibility in
light of all the others telling them hot deploys are worthless, but it's
tiring and I'm outnumbered, so I wrote a blog.

## A Brief History

I got involved in Elixir in 2013. I came via Java and C# and Ruby and
Clojure, et. al., without any deep history with BEAM, but I found a depth of
experience and wisdom in distributed systems that reinvigorated my interest in
programming and has made me want to dig into Erlang history. I've read the
writings and watched the videos from Joe Armstrong and Robert Virding about the
history of the platform. This is a distilled version through my lens and any
inaccuracies are my fault.

The government was going to charge Ericsson huge penalties for any downtime for
phone switches, therefore the original Erlang team had a primary requirement of
zero downtime. The core features enabling that are hot code loading (to upgrade
software) and supervision across physical machines (in case of hardware
failure). All other features (and limitations) can probably be traced to one of
those two core features. The links and monitors that enable supervision are
things we all use even within a single VM. Just as supervision is useful even
without physical redundancy, perhaps there's value in hot code loading even when we
don't require zero downtime.

## The Middle Ground

Let's make a distinction between _relying_ on hot deploys and simply enjoying
them. To rely upon them means to architect your system where it must remain
running constantly. You pay for that up-time with more complex deploys.  You'll
have to write and test custom appup/relup files and code_changed callbacks for
situations when you need to change your supervision tree and/or modify things
stored in some long-running GenServer state. This is a daunting notion to get
consistently correct and most people stop learning about hot deploys at this
point, however, I find that 90% (or more) of my deploys do not require these
sorts of changes.  Most of my changes are to the logic in the plain modules
called via the existing process supervision tree. Changing the structure of the
tree itself is much less frequent.

Distillery automatically generates relup files that allows me to hot deploy
plain modules "for free" over 90% of the time. As long as I ensure my system
durably stores important data, refreshes caches properly at startup, etc. for
the other 10% of cases, then I can use a full restart release. I've never
written appup/relup files or code_changed callbacks, yet I've been enjoying hot
deploys for 3 years. I gain a lot of value for very little effort. Hot deploys
are cool!  They allow all the thousands of background tasks that are always
running in my system to keep running without interruption. That's quite
convenient.

## Context Matters

There's some of you who have been saying "but Docker ..." to yourselves since
reading the title of this blog. Docker (which I'll use loosely as a proxy for
containerization/orchestration in general) is the right organizational decision
in certain contexts. Like all decisions, it has tradeoffs and one of the tradeoffs
is to treat your various microservices in various languages at a common denominator
level in order to streamline operational concerns. To someone working in the
context of a company that has invested in that style of architecture, yeah, I can
see the logic of deciding not to support hot deploys, even at the "middle ground"
level. But there are other contexts and newcomers to Elixir shouldn't immediately
be assumed to be under those tradeoffs/constraints.

My current context is at a small startup that built upon Elixir from day one
(though I have prior experience at larger, more perscriptive (micro)service
oriented organizations too). Our system consists mostly of periodic background
tasks we do on behalf of our customers. Our Phoenix component primarily
displays status and allows for the occasional manual step. The UI is a small
portion of our overall traffic. The problem domain matches the concurrency
benefits Elixir and BEAM offer quite nicely. It's not a conventional CRUD
webapp, yet it is somewhat architecturally adjacent, and we do enjoy our 90%
hot deploys.

## Newbie Advice

To those new to the Elixir (and BEAM) community, welcome! There's going to be
different ways of doing things here, and that can be frustrating, but try to
remember there is a reason for the differences, even if you don't immediately see
them. Hot deploys probably shouldn't be at the top of your list of things to delve
into, but I encourage you to keep the idea in the back of your mind instead of
completely writing it off. I suggest, when you're ready, that you explore it on
some side project, where you have few constraints. It will help you gain intuition
of which contexts it is a good or bad fit for. At risk of getting too philosophical,
that intuition of technology/technique to context is core to leveling up
as a software developer.
