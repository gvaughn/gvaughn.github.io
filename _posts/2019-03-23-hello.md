I had a blog many years ago as a young Java programmer, but let the domain lapse. Time to start over.

I spent my Saturday reading about Github Pages, their custom themes, and jekyll. After a few false starts,
I got something working that includes an RSS feed. I still should put a bio over in the sidebar, but for
the most part, this seems like a nice low-friction way for me to write up ideas that are too long to fit
in tweets. I have high hopes that having this set up will get me writing more.
